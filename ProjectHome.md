HtmlUnitScripter (also known as HtmlUnit Scripter) is a Firefox extension that generates Java code based on items that you interact with while using the browser. The generated Java code can then be copied into a Java class that uses HtmlUnit jars (available at http://htmlunit.sourceforge.net) to interact with web pages. HtmlUnitScripter can track the actions of clicking a mouse and filling in text on a web page. For questions, comments, or bugs, email grossm04@gmail.com

Note- as of version 1.1.1, a separate jar is no longer required to execute tests created with HtmlUnitScripter. Web page saving code is generated along with the generated Java test class. You need HtmlUnit version 2.7 or higher, as these versions contain the HtmlUnit page saving API. If you are using HtmlUnit 2.5 or earlier, you will need to use HtmlUnitScripter 1.1.0.
